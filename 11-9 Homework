    <h2>My intro</h2>
    <!-- Include: a brief intro to yourself -- where you're from, what you like to do for fun, what you're studying, and who your community or family is. -->
    <!-- Tags to use: <p>, <strong>, <i> -->
        <p>My name's Ian Nicholas. I'm from New Canaan, CT; about an hour outside New York City. At Syracuse University I'm a sophomore broadcast and digital journalism major with a <i> passion </i> for <strong> sports broadcasting </strong>. I spend most of my free time honing my craft at three on-campus media organizations in <strong> CitrusTV, WAER, and Z89 </strong>. When I'm not behind the mic, you can find me binging a Netflix series, making a trip to the movie theatre, or playing on my XBOX. As an only child, I spend plenty of time with my parents, but I also carve out alone time with my dog Maxine.</p>     

    <h2>My handles</h2>
    <!- Include: at least two handles for your social media accounts -->
