			<h3>Lockdown Lonliness</h3>
			<p id="with-element">Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic’s height in 2020, people around the world found themselves extremely lonely while locked indoors during isolation. Without the ability to interact with friends and family, a need for companionship increased significantly. In order to fill the void, man’s best friend stepped up in a big way. Per the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, almost one out of every five US households adopted a pet at the peak of COVID-19. Of course, the United States’ largest city played a significant role in the pet frenzy, with a big desire for dogs.</p>
			<p id="with-element">But in order to own a dog in New York City, the pet must have a license. With fines imminent for owners who don’t license their dogs, pet licensing went through the roof in all of the five boroughs. According to a dataset from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, over 147,000 dogs were licensed in the Big Apple from September 2014 to March 2021. The majority of these pets, however, were licensed in a two-year span from 2019-2020, nearly 137,000 to be precise. That number represents 93% of dogs licensed in New York City across that specific six and a half year stretch.</p>

		<p id="with-element">One person who knew this data well was Ben Joergens, a blogger for Medium. Joergens wanted to dive into the reality of dog ownership in NYC mid-pandemic. Although dog licensing spiked around the apex of COVID-19, dogs weren’t the only pets that saw their ownership soar in the Big Apple. Joergens noted, “Although the pandemic definitely boosted the want for dogs, it also boosted interest in companionship, period. For dog lovers and non-dog lovers. I figured out the whole story by sifting through data from both the ACC (Animal Care Centers of NYC) and a couple Google Trend searches. Interest for dogs rose a ton in 2020, by over 25%. But people also went out and adopted plenty of cats, guinea pigs, and rabbits, too. Interest for all three rose by 10 to 15%. Even as the pandemic lasted through the summer, interest for dogs didn’t increase throughout the year. Although the weather got warmer, a lot of people didn’t want to risk going outside. Dogs need to go outside a lot more than cats do, and that made an impact.”</p>

			<h3>Coast to Coast</h3>
			<p>The Big Apple wasn’t the only large city in the United States that experienced an overall bump in pet licensing as a result of the pandemic. In 2019, a tad over 3,400 pets were licensed throughout the city of Seattle. That number jumped to north of 18,900 just one year later. Evidently, COVID-19 played a massive role in the Emerald City’s pet licensing rate skyrocketing by 550%.</p>

			<p>“With the exception of 2016 to 2017, there is an upward trend for all other years, with the license growth between 2019 and 2020 being particularly large, as the number of registered pets in 2020 is nearly 6 times larger than that of the previous year. This substantial increase can likely be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic when many families got pandemic pets to take care of during quarantine.” Similar to the trend found in New York City, few owners in Seattle licensed their pets pre-2019. The year 2015 saw a grand total of three pets being licensed throughout the city. This number stayed in the single digits for the next few years and only bumped up to 54 pets by 2018. It wasn’t until a year later when pet licensing spiked to 3,000 in 2019. </p>

			<p>As dog ownership went off the walls, another variable that became tracked well was what kinds of dogs were being adopted and eventually licensed. As of October 2021, Seattle’s home to 32,000 licensed dogs. Countless dog breeds make up the cities’ dog population, but a handful of breeds stood out according to PODWU data which stated “the most common dog primary breeds were the labrador retriever, golden retriever, short coat chihuahua, German shepherd, and terrier.” The three specific breeds that have a thousand-plus representatives in Seattle households include the short coat chihuahua, the labrador retriever and the golden retriever. The most common breed is easily the labrador retriever with a frequency of 3,800; more than 2.3 times the second most common breed in the golden retriever. Back in the Big Apple, much like the city itself, its most common dog breed happens to feature a little bit of everything. A little under 18% of dogs licensed in New York City are listed by the cities’ Department of Health and Mental Hygiene as unknown, better known as a mutt. The chihuahua was also well represented in NYC, clocking in at second at 5% of the total licensed dog population.</p>
